This project is a recipe book webpage that holds 3 distinct recipes including Zuppa Toscana, Mac and cheese and apple pie. 
I have linked all the web pages to each other adding images to each of them and produced two different types of lists such as unordered and ordered lists.
I have also used italicization and bolded text to demonstrate importance of some words.
Other things such as heading, paragraphs and boilerplate has been completed mastered as shown in this project of mine.
